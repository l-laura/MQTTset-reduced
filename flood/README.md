The flood sample data was not generated by the same method as other MQTTset samples,
due to the processing being based on flows, of which flood.pcap only contains one.
To reproduce this data, run:

```bash
cd flood-split
PcapSplitter -f flood.pcap -o . -m file-size -p 700000
```

then rename the created files to `train.pcap` and `test.pcap`.

Source file: flood.pcap
Flows in training set: 1
Flows in validation set: 0
Flows in test set: 1
